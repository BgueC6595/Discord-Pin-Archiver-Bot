# Discord Pin Archiver Bot
Pin Archiver is a Discord bot that was specifically made for the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/ZZFJhdr) of the alumni ran [Subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/) for the University of Waterloo; however, since then, the bot has been made open source for the public to use. 

Pin Archiver has the following features:
* Fetch the last pinned message of the current channel.
* Clone all pinned messages in the server to a specified channel.
* Pin a message in the current channel if it recieves a certain number of reactions.
* Archive any message to a specified channel via the message id.
* Delete the last message from a specified channel.
* Delete the oldest pinned message in the channel once the maximum number of pinned messages has been reached.

## Usage
If you would like to use this bot in your own server please feel free to clone the repository and host it yourself. If you go this route, you will need to edit the various channel and user-ids in `config.ini` for the bot to work properly.
